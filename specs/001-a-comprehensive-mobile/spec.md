## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-29
- Q: What is the specific geographic boundary that defines "AfrikaBurn event location" for unlocking restricted content? ‚Üí A: GPS coordinates with radius (e.g., 5km from event center)
- Q: How should the app prioritize essential data when device storage is low? ‚Üí A: Safety info > Maps > Static content > Community features > Event schedule
- Q: What specific battery consumption targets should the app meet for "extended use in remote locations"? ‚Üí A: 24+ hours with moderate usage pattern
- Q: How should the app handle authentication and user identity for community features? ‚Üí A: Anonymous participation with device-based identity
- Q: What is the maximum acceptable delay for syncing new data when connectivity becomes available? ‚Üí A: 48 hours

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an AfrikaBurn participant traveling to the remote Tankwa Karoo desert, I need a comprehensive mobile application that provides essential survival tools, event information, and community features that work reliably offline, so that I can safely navigate, participate in, and enjoy the event regardless of network connectivity.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am preparing for AfrikaBurn at home with internet, **When** I download and set up the app, **Then** I can access driving directions, preparation guides, packing checklists, and safety guidelines while sensitive event information remains hidden
2. **Given** I am driving to the Tankwa Karoo with intermittent connectivity, **When** I use the offline navigation features, **Then** the app provides step-by-step driving directions to the event location without requiring network access
3. **Given** I have arrived at the AfrikaBurn event location, **When** I open the app, **Then** previously hidden event content (theme camps, art installations, performances) becomes accessible and displays on the offline map with GPS coordinates
4. **Given** I am setting up my camp at the event, **When** I use the map feature, **Then** I can mark my camp location on the offline map and easily navigate back to it from anywhere on the event grounds
5. **Given** I am exploring the event with no network connectivity, **When** I use the map, **Then** I can see GPS locations of theme camps, art installations, facilities, and other features with full offline functionality
6. **Given** I want to find specific activities or art, **When** I use the discovery features, **Then** I can browse theme camps, art installations, and events with location information and navigate to them using GPS
7. **Given** I need emergency assistance or safety information, **When** I access safety features, **Then** I can find emergency contacts, medical facilities, and safety guidelines that work offline

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the app cannot determine location to unlock event content?
- How does the system handle partial or corrupted event data from organizers?
- What occurs when device storage is low and offline data needs to be prioritized?
- How does the app behave when transitioning between online and offline states?
- What happens if event dates change or are cancelled after content is downloaded?

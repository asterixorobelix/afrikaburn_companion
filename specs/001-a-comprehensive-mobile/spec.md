**Feature Branch**: `001-a-comprehensive-mobile`  
**Created**: 2025-09-29  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "A comprehensive mobile app for AfrikaBurn, the South African regional Burning Man event. Built with Compose Multiplatform to provide essential tools for surviving and thriving in the Tankwa Karoo desert."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an AfrikaBurn participant traveling to the remote Tankwa Karoo desert, I need a comprehensive mobile application that provides essential survival tools, event information, and community features that work reliably offline, so that I can safely navigate, participate in, and enjoy the event regardless of network connectivity.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am preparing for AfrikaBurn at home with internet, **When** I download and set up the app, **Then** I can access general information, driving directions, and safety guidelines while sensitive event information remains hidden
2. **Given** I am driving to the Tankwa Karoo with intermittent connectivity, **When** I use the navigation features, **Then** the app provides offline-capable directions and location services without requiring constant network access
3. **Given** I have arrived at the AfrikaBurn event location, **When** I open the app, **Then** previously hidden event content (theme camps, art, performances) becomes accessible based on my location
4. **Given** I am at the event with no network connectivity, **When** I use any core feature, **Then** all essential functionality works completely offline including maps, schedules, and safety tools
5. **Given** I want to connect with other participants, **When** I use community features, **Then** I can find and interact with other attendees while respecting the event's gifting and non-commercial principles

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the app cannot determine location to unlock event content?
- How does the system handle partial or corrupted event data from organizers?
- What occurs when device storage is low and offline data needs to be prioritized?
- How does the app behave when transitioning between online and offline states?
- What happens if event dates change or are cancelled after content is downloaded?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Core Offline Functionality
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide complete offline functionality for all essential features without requiring network connectivity
- **FR-002**: System MUST store all critical event data locally on the device for offline access
- **FR-003**: System MUST sync new data when connectivity is available without disrupting offline operations

#### Event Information Management
- **FR-004**: System MUST hide sensitive event information (theme camps, mutant vehicles, performances, art installations, events, mobile art) until event start date or location-based unlock
- **FR-005**: System MUST display non-sensitive information (driving directions, general About content, safety guidelines) at any time
- **FR-006**: System MUST use previous year's event data for demonstration and development purposes when current year data is unavailable
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle incomplete, inconsistent, or last-minute data from event organizers gracefully

#### Location and Navigation
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide offline-capable navigation and mapping for the Tankwa Karoo region
- **FR-009**: System MUST detect when users have arrived at the event location to unlock restricted content
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide safety and emergency location features that work without network connectivity

#### Community and Social Features
- **FR-011**: System MUST facilitate community connection while adhering to AfrikaBurn's Ten Principles (radical inclusion, gifting, decommodification, radical self-reliance, radical self-expression, communal effort, civic responsibility, leaving no trace, participation, immediacy)
- **FR-012**: System MUST support gifting and non-commercial interaction patterns
- **FR-013**: System MUST respect participant privacy and consent in all social features

#### Performance and Reliability
- **FR-014**: System MUST operate reliably in extreme desert conditions including high temperatures, dust, and limited battery power
- **FR-015**: System MUST optimize battery consumption for extended use in remote locations
- **FR-016**: System MUST handle device storage limitations intelligently, prioritizing essential data

#### Data and Content Management
- **FR-017**: System MUST separate current year and previous year event data clearly
- **FR-018**: System MUST validate and sanitize all external data inputs from event organizers
- **FR-019**: System MUST provide fallback content when primary data sources are unavailable

#### Observability and Support
- **FR-020**: System MUST log essential diagnostic information for remote troubleshooting when users cannot be directly accessed
- **FR-021**: System MUST protect user privacy in all logging and crash reporting
- **FR-022**: System MUST provide clear feedback to users about app status, connectivity, and data freshness

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Participant**: Event attendee who uses the app for navigation, information, and community connection; has privacy preferences and location status
- **Event Information**: Time-sensitive data including theme camps, performances, art installations that must be hidden until appropriate disclosure conditions are met
- **Static Content**: Non-sensitive information like driving directions, safety guidelines, and general event information that can be displayed anytime
- **Location Data**: Geographic information for navigation, safety, and event content unlocking; includes current position and Tankwa Karoo boundaries
- **Community Content**: User-generated content that facilitates gifting, connection, and participation while respecting event principles
- **Event Schedule**: Time-based information about performances, workshops, and activities that supports event participation
- **Safety Information**: Emergency contacts, medical facilities, safety guidelines, and hazard information for desert survival
- **Historical Data**: Previous year's event information used for development, testing, and fallback scenarios when current data is unavailable

# Brand Positioning — AfrikaBurn Companion

## Who This Is For

People standing on the edge of the Tankwa Karoo — literally or figuratively — asking themselves: *will I be okay out there?*

Some are first-timers. They've read the survival guide three times, joined every WhatsApp group, and still don't feel ready. The desert is unforgiving and the event is deliberately disorienting. They've heard stories about dust storms that white out the playa, about getting lost at 3am in a city with no street names, about running out of water because they underestimated the heat. They want to be brave enough to surrender to the experience, but they need something solid under their feet first.

Others have done this five, ten times. They don't need hand-holding — they need a quick way to find that sound camp they heard about, mark where they left their tent, or check when the temple burn starts. They've built their own systems over the years (screenshots of PDF maps, bookmarked web pages, handwritten notes) and they work, mostly. But every year there's something they miss because the information was buried in a Facebook post from three weeks ago.

Both groups want the same thing: to spend less time figuring out logistics and more time *being there*.

## How It Should Feel

**Before opening the app:** Scattered. Information lives in WhatsApp groups, PDFs, websites, word of mouth, and memory. There's a low-grade anxiety that you're forgetting something or missing something. For first-timers, this tips into genuine fear of the unknown.

**While using the app:**
- **Grounded.** Not calm — the desert isn't calm. But the feeling of having your bearings. Knowing where you are, where your camp is, where water is. The anxiety drops from your shoulders because the essentials are handled.
- **Curious.** The app reveals the event's richness without overwhelming you. You discover things naturally — an art piece you didn't know existed, a camp offering something unexpected. It feeds the sense of possibility that draws people to AfrikaBurn in the first place.
- **Independent.** You're using a tool, not following instructions. The app respects that you're a participant, not a tourist. It gives you what you need and gets out of the way.

**After closing the app:** You put your phone away and look up. The app did its job when you stop thinking about it. You're oriented, you have a plan (or you've decided to have no plan), and the desert is waiting.

## What It Is

- A compass for the playa — not a GPS that barks directions, but a compass you check when you want to.
- The digital equivalent of the experienced burner at your camp who knows where everything is and doesn't make you feel stupid for asking.
- An offline-first survival tool dressed in the language of discovery.
- A quiet ally in a loud, beautiful, overwhelming place.

## What It Is Not

- **Not a social media app.** No feeds, no likes, no followers, no stories. AfrikaBurn is about radical presence — being *here*, not performing *here* for an audience somewhere else. The moment we add a share button that optimises for engagement, we've betrayed the event's spirit. No.
- **Not a commercial platform.** No ads, no sponsored listings, no "featured camps." Decommodification is a core principle of the burn. The app cannot have a business model that conflicts with the community's values. If a theme camp appears in search results, it's because you searched for it — not because someone paid for placement.
- **Not a helicopter parent.** No push notifications nagging you to hydrate. No "you're missing an event starting NOW!" alerts. Radical self-reliance means the user decides when to engage. The app is a tool on a shelf, not an assistant tapping your shoulder. If someone wants to wander aimlessly for three days, the app should make that easy too.
- **Not a generic festival app.** This is not Coachella. There are no VIP areas, no headliner announcements, no Instagram-optimised stages. This is harsh desert, radical community, no spectators. The app's design language must reflect the Tankwa — raw, warm, dust-covered, and alive — not the sanitised aesthetic of mainstream event apps.

## The Core Feeling

**Oriented in the unknown.**

You don't need to understand the whole desert. You just need to know where you are and what's around you. The rest is the adventure.

# Voice & Messaging

## Tagline

**Find your way. Lose yourself.**

Six words. The contradiction is the point — the app handles orientation so you can surrender to the experience. "Find" is practical (navigation, search, discovery). "Lose yourself" is the emotional payoff (immersion, presence, freedom). Works on the app store, on a splash screen, in a one-line description.

Alternatives to hold in reserve:
- *Your compass for the Tankwa*
- *Navigate the dust*
- *The desert, in your pocket*

## Core Message

AfrikaBurn happens in one of the harshest environments in Southern Africa — no cell signal, no street names, no safety net except the one you build yourself. Every year, participants piece together survival information from WhatsApp groups, PDFs, and word of mouth, hoping nothing critical falls through the cracks. AfrikaBurn Companion puts everything you need — offline maps, camp locations, art installations, safety info, driving directions — in one place that works without connectivity. It doesn't try to be your guide. It tries to be the ground under your feet, so you can look up.

## Brand Pillars

### 1. Desert-Ready
Everything in this app must work in the Tankwa Karoo. That means offline-first, battery-conscious, readable in blinding sunlight and pitch darkness. If a feature requires connectivity to be useful, it doesn't ship. If an animation drains 2% battery for a pretty transition, it gets cut. The desert is the test environment, not a lab — and the desert doesn't care about your design awards.

### 2. Respect the Participant
Users are not tourists to be managed. They're participants in a radical, self-reliant community. The app provides information when asked for it. It doesn't push, suggest, rank, or curate unless the user initiates. No dark patterns, no engagement hooks, no "keep exploring!" prompts. The most respectful thing a tool can do is be excellent at its job and then shut up.

### 3. Reveal, Don't Overwhelm
AfrikaBurn has hundreds of camps, art installations, performances, and experiences. Dumping all of that on a user is useless. The app uses progressive disclosure — search when you want to find something specific, browse when you want to discover, and the map as the spatial anchor that ties it together. Geofenced content means the event reveals itself as you arrive, mirroring the physical experience of driving into the Tankwa and seeing the city emerge from the dust.

### 4. Rooted in Place
This app is for AfrikaBurn. Not Burning Man. Not "burns in general." The Tankwa Karoo has its own character — the ochre dust, the dry river beds, the relentless sun, the cold desert nights, the stars you can't believe are real. The app's visual language, tone, and functionality should feel like they belong to this specific place. Generic is the enemy.

## Voice & Tone

### Voice (consistent — who we are)

**Plain-spoken.** Say it simply. "Find water" not "Locate hydration resources." If a burner would say it in three words around a fire, so do we. No corporate language, no startup jargon, no false enthusiasm.

**Warm but not cute.** We care about the user's safety and experience, and it shows in how thoroughly we built this. But we don't perform caring with exclamation marks and emoji. Warmth is in the substance, not the decoration.

**Locally grounded.** We say "the Tankwa" not "the event venue." We say "playa" when burners say playa. We reference dust storms, not "weather events." The app speaks the language of the community it serves.

**Confident.** The app knows what it is. No hedging, no "we think you might like..." Just clear information, clearly presented. Confidence is quiet.

### Tone (shifts by context)

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Normal / browsing | Matter-of-fact, warm | "3 art installations near you" |
| Errors / failures | Honest, practical | "Can't load this right now. You're offline — but your saved data is still here." |
| Empty states | Gentle, contextual | "No camps match that filter. Try broadening your search." |
| Onboarding / first launch | Welcoming, unhurried | "Welcome to AfrikaBurn Companion. Everything here works offline." |
| Success / confirmation | Brief, affirming | "Camp location saved." |
| Safety / emergency | Direct, no filler | "Emergency contacts. Rangers: [number]. Medical: [number]." |
| Geofence unlock | Understated excitement | "Welcome to the Tankwa. The event is now unlocked." |

### Words We Use

| Use | Instead Of |
|---|---|
| the Tankwa | the venue, the event location |
| camp | campsite, accommodation |
| art / installation | exhibit, display |
| playa | grounds, area, field |
| burn | event, festival |
| participants | users, attendees, visitors |
| gift / gifting | free, giveaway, deal |
| explore | browse, check out |
| mark your camp | set home location, save address |
| offline | no signal, disconnected |

### Words We Don't Use
- "festival" — AfrikaBurn is not a festival. It's a burn. The distinction matters to the community and signals that we understand it.
- "content" — People don't go to AfrikaBurn for content. They go for experiences. We describe what things *are*, not what category they fit in.
- "community-driven" — We are, but saying it sounds like a pitch deck. Show it in the product, don't label it.
- "amazing" / "awesome" / "incredible" — Cheap superlatives. The art and the desert are genuinely breathtaking — our copy doesn't need to compete.
- "users" — They're participants. In copy that touches the user directly, we say "you." Internally, we say "participants."
- "algorithm" / "curated for you" / "recommended" — Implies we're deciding what you should see. We're not. You decide.
- "unlock achievements" / "earn badges" — Gamification language. The only thing you unlock is the event itself when you arrive.

# Brand Guidelines

## Logo

**Current state:** The app uses the name "Afrikaburn" as its primary identifier. No custom logo or symbol has been established yet.

**Direction:** The logo should feel hand-made, not corporate. Think stamped, stencilled, or sun-bleached — something that could exist on a wooden sign at a theme camp entrance. A wordmark with a symbol is preferred over a symbol alone, since "AfrikaBurn Companion" needs to be readable on an app store listing.

### Usage Rules
- Always use on a solid background (never over photography or complex textures)
- Minimum clear space: the height of the "A" on all sides
- Monochrome versions required for both light and dark contexts
- Do not rearrange "AfrikaBurn" and "Companion" — they stay as a unit

### Logo Misuse
- Do not add gradients, glows, or drop shadows
- Do not stretch, rotate, or skew
- Do not place on a busy background without a container
- Do not use AfrikaBurn's official event logo — this is a companion app, not an official product
- Do not use fire/flame imagery — too literal, too generic

## Colour

### Current State

The app uses **default Material Design 3 purple** (`#6750A4`). This is generic and has no connection to AfrikaBurn, the Tankwa, or the brand's emotional positioning. It reads as "developer didn't change the defaults."

### Proposed Direction

The colour palette should be drawn from the Tankwa Karoo itself: ochre dust, rust-red earth, bleached-bone whites, deep desert night sky, and the warm amber of fire. These will be refined in Phase 4 with visual inspiration, but the principles are established here.

### Colour Principles
1. **Earned from the land.** Every colour must be traceable to something real in the Tankwa. No arbitrary brand colours. If you can't point to it in a photo of the playa, it doesn't belong.
2. **Status colours stay universal.** Red means danger/error, amber means warning, green means safe/success. These are not decoration — in a survival context, colour-coded status information can matter. Never use brand colours where status colours should be.
3. **Dark mode is the primary mode.** Most intense app usage happens at night when participants are exploring. Dark mode isn't an afterthought — it's the default experience. Light mode exists for daytime readability.
4. **High contrast in extremes.** The app must be readable in blinding midday sun and in complete darkness. Contrast ratios should exceed WCAG AA (4.5:1 for body text, 3:1 for large text) in both modes.
5. **Warm, not cool.** The Tankwa is warm — even the shadows have warmth. The palette should lean warm across both light and dark modes. Cool neutrals (blue-greys) feel wrong here.

### Semantic Colours

| Role | Light Mode | Dark Mode | When to Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| Success / Safe | `#2E7D32` | `#81C784` | Water available, camp saved, sync complete |
| Warning / Caution | `#E65100` | `#FFB74D` | Dust storm alert, low battery warning, schedule conflict |
| Error / Emergency | `#C62828` | `#EF9A9A` | Emergency info, failed action, critical alert |
| Info | `#1565C0` | `#64B5F6` | General information, tips, neutral status |

*Primary and surface colours will be defined in Phase 4 after analysing visual inspiration.*

## Typography

### Current State

The app uses **system default fonts** across the full Material 3 type scale. This is functional but generic — it doesn't contribute to the brand's sense of place.

### Proposed Direction

**Display/Heading font:** To be selected in Phase 4. Requirements:
- Open source, available on Google Fonts
- Variable weight or at minimum Regular + Bold
- Must feel grounded and slightly rough — not geometric, not corporate
- Good readability at small sizes (camp names on map markers)
- Cross-platform compatible (Android + iOS)

**Body font:** System default (Roboto on Android, SF Pro on iOS). Body text should be invisible — the reader should never notice the font. System fonts achieve this and guarantee performance.

**Cut point:** Display font for `displayLarge` through `titleLarge`. System font for `titleMedium` and below.

### Type Scale (current)

| Style | Size / Weight | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| Display Large | 57sp / Regular | Unused currently — reserve for splash/hero |
| Display Medium | 45sp / Regular | Unused currently |
| Display Small | 36sp / Regular | Screen headers (if needed) |
| Headline Large | 32sp / Regular | Section headers |
| Headline Medium | 28sp / Regular | Card titles, camp names |
| Headline Small | 24sp / Regular | Sub-section headers |
| Title Large | 22sp / Regular | Primary navigation, prominent labels |
| Title Medium | 16sp / Medium | Card subtitles, secondary labels |
| Title Small | 14sp / Medium | Tertiary labels, metadata |
| Body Large | 16sp / Regular | Primary reading text, descriptions |
| Body Medium | 14sp / Regular | Secondary text, supporting info |
| Body Small | 12sp / Regular | Captions, timestamps |
| Label Large | 14sp / Medium | Buttons, tabs, chips |
| Label Medium | 12sp / Medium | Small labels, tags |
| Label Small | 11sp / Medium | Tiny metadata |

### Type Rules
- No all-caps except Label styles used in buttons/tabs (Material 3 default)
- No italic for emphasis — use Medium weight or colour contrast
- No decorative or script typefaces anywhere in the app
- Stick to the scale — no ad-hoc font sizes
- Minimum readable size: 12sp (Body Small). Nothing below this.

## Spacing & Layout

### Spacing Scale (from Dimens object)

| Token | Value | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `paddingExtraSmall` | 4dp | Tight internal padding (chips, badges) |
| `paddingSmall` / `spacingSmall` | 8dp | Default internal padding, list item gaps |
| `spacingMedium` | 12dp | Between related elements in a group |
| `paddingMedium` / `spacingLarge` | 16dp | Card padding, section gaps |
| `sectionSpacing` | 20dp | Between distinct content sections |
| `paddingLarge` / `spacingExtraLarge` | 24dp | Screen-level padding, large gaps |
| `paddingExtraLarge` | 32dp | Hero spacing, major section breaks |

### Layout Principles
- **Touch targets: 48dp minimum.** Non-negotiable. Dusty fingers on a hot screen in the desert need generous targets.
- **Density over sprawl.** Screen real estate is precious — users are often glancing at the app quickly, not scrolling leisurely. Prefer compact, scannable layouts.
- **Cards are the primary container.** Camp info, art details, event listings — all in cards. Cards provide clear boundaries and work well as tap targets.
- **Map is full-bleed.** The map screen uses all available space. No decorative margins.
- **Bottom navigation stays visible.** Navigation is the lifeline. It doesn't hide on scroll.

## Corner Radius

| Token | Value | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `cornerRadiusXSmall` | 2dp | Tiny elements (progress bars) |
| `cornerRadiusSmall` | 4dp | Chips, badges, small containers |
| `cornerRadiusMedium` | 8dp | Cards, dialogs, text fields |
| `cornerRadiusLarge` | 16dp | Bottom sheets, large containers, images |

**Shape philosophy:** Rounded but not bubbly. The app should feel approachable (not sharp/corporate) but grounded (not playful/childish). 8dp is the workhorse radius. 16dp is the maximum — nothing rounder.

## Iconography

### Style
- Material Symbols Outlined (default weight 400)
- 24dp default size (`iconSizeMedium`)
- Outlined variant, not filled — lighter visual weight suits the app's "tool, not toy" positioning

### Sizing

| Token | Value | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `iconSizeSmall` | 16dp | Inline with text, metadata |
| `iconSizeMedium` | 24dp | Default — nav bar, list items, buttons |
| `iconSizeLarge` | 48dp | Empty states, feature highlights |
| `iconSizeExtraLarge` | 64dp | Hero illustrations |
| `iconSizeHero` | 96dp | Splash, onboarding |

### Rules
- Every icon must have a `contentDescription` for screen readers
- Icons inherit colour from their semantic context (on-surface for default, on-primary for primary containers)
- No emoji as icons
- No custom illustrations in place of standard icons — consistency over personality
- Exception: the map uses custom pin markers, which follow their own visual system

## Motion & Animation

| Token | Duration | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `animationDurationShort` | 150ms | Micro-interactions (press, toggle, selection) |
| `animationDurationMedium` | 300ms | Screen transitions, card expand/collapse |
| `animationDurationLong` | 450ms | Complex animations, skeleton loading |
| `staggerDelayPerItem` | 50ms | List item stagger on load |

### Principles
- **Functional, not decorative.** Every animation must communicate state change. No animations for vibes.
- **Interruptible.** Users can tap through animations. Nothing blocks interaction.
- **Battery-aware.** Reduce motion on low-battery devices if platform supports it. Respect system "reduce motion" settings.
- **Skeleton loading over spinners.** Lists show skeleton placeholders, not circular spinners. Skeletons communicate structure; spinners communicate "wait."

## Elevation & Depth

| Level | Value | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0dp | Flat surfaces, backgrounds |
| 1 | 2dp (`elevationSmall`) | Cards at rest, subtle lift |
| 2 | 4dp (`elevationMedium`) | Cards on hover/press, app bar |
| 3 | 8dp (`elevationNormal`) | Dialogs, bottom sheets, FABs |

**Depth philosophy:** Mostly flat. Elevation is used sparingly to indicate interactivity (cards you can tap) and layering (sheets over content). The app should feel like a map spread on a table, not a stack of floating cards.

## Dark Mode

Dark mode is the **primary experience** for AfrikaBurn Companion. Most active usage occurs at night — navigating between camps, finding art installations, checking the schedule. Light mode exists for daytime but dark mode gets first-class treatment.

### Rules
- No pure black (`#000000`) backgrounds. Use warm dark surfaces to maintain the Tankwa warmth.
- Surface hierarchy through colour, not elevation shadows (shadows disappear on dark backgrounds).
- Status/semantic colours must be adjusted for dark backgrounds — use lighter, desaturated variants.
- All content must meet WCAG AA contrast ratios in dark mode.
- Test every screen in dark mode. If it only looks good in light mode, it's not done.
- Map tiles should have a dark/night variant or be dimmed at night.

## Imagery & Illustration

### What We Use
- **Photography:** Real photos of AfrikaBurn, the Tankwa, and art installations. Dusty, warm, authentic. Not stock photography. Not HDR-processed. The kind of photo a participant would take.
- **Maps:** The offline map is a core visual element. Map styling should reflect the brand palette — warm surface colours, clear labels, distinctive pin markers.
- **Icons:** Material Symbols for UI. Custom markers for map features.

### What We Don't Use
- Stock photography of generic "festival" scenes
- 3D renders or illustrated mascots
- Decorative gradients or abstract backgrounds
- Fire/flame imagery (too literal, too generic burn-culture cliché)

### Empty States
- Use a single icon (48-64dp) from Material Symbols
- One line of text explaining what would be here
- Optional action button if the user can resolve it
- No illustrations, no sad-face emoji, no jokes about tumbleweeds

## Accessibility

- **Contrast:** WCAG AA minimum (4.5:1 body text, 3:1 large text) in both light and dark modes. Target AAA (7:1) where possible.
- **Content descriptions:** Every interactive element and meaningful image must have a `contentDescription`. Decorative elements use `null`.
- **Touch targets:** 48dp minimum on all interactive elements. No exceptions.
- **Colour is never the sole indicator.** Status information uses colour + icon + text. A colourblind participant must be able to use every feature.
- **Dynamic type:** Support system font scaling up to 200%. Test layouts at maximum scale.
- **Screen reader:** Test full navigation flows with TalkBack (Android) and VoiceOver (iOS). Every screen must be fully navigable.

## App Store Presence

### Screenshots
- Show the app in context: map with real camp pins, art installation detail, directions screen
- Dark mode screenshots first (it's the primary experience)
- Device frames on a warm, dusty background — not white or gradient
- No text overlays that obscure the UI
- Show offline capability prominently — "Works without signal" is a key selling point

### Store Description
- Open with the problem: "AfrikaBurn happens in the middle of nowhere. No signal. No street names."
- Mention offline-first within the first two sentences
- Name the Tankwa Karoo — specificity signals authenticity
- Do not use "festival" — say "burn" or "event"
- Do not use "the ultimate" or "all-in-one" — underpromise

### Ratings & Reviews
- Respond in the same voice as the app: plain-spoken, warm, direct
- Acknowledge problems honestly: "That's a real issue. We're fixing it in the next update."
- Never be defensive or corporate
- Thank participants, not "users"

---

## One-Line Test

Every feature, colour choice, animation, or piece of copy must pass this question:

> **"Does this help someone find their way in the Tankwa — or does it get in the way?"**

If it doesn't help orientation (physical, informational, or emotional) and it doesn't get out of the way, it doesn't belong.

1. **Create Repository** (if using as template):
   - Click "Use this template" → "Create a new repository"
   - Choose repository name and visibility
   - Clone to your local machine

2. **Run Setup Script**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ./setup.sh
   ```
   - Follow prompts to customize package name and project details

### 2. Firebase Integration

#### 🔥 Android Firebase Setup

1. **Download Configuration**:
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
   - Select your project → Project Settings
   - In "Your apps" section, click Android app
   - Download `google-services.json`

2. **Add as Repository Secret**:
   - GitHub Repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - **Name**: `FIREBASE_CONFIG_JSON`
   - **Value**: Copy entire contents of `google-services.json` file
   - Click "Add secret"

#### 🍎 iOS Firebase Setup (Optional)

1. **Download iOS Configuration**:
   - In Firebase Console, click iOS app (if added)
   - Download `GoogleService-Info.plist`

2. **Add as Repository Secret**:
   - **Name**: `IOS_FIREBASE_CONFIG_PLIST`
   - **Value**: Copy entire contents of `GoogleService-Info.plist` file

### 3. Android Release Signing (Production)

For production releases, add Android signing secrets:

1. **Generate Keystore** (if you don't have one):
   ```bash
   keytool -genkey -v -keystore release-key.keystore -alias release -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
   ```

2. **Add Repository Secrets**:
   - `ANDROID_SIGNING_KEY`: Base64 encoded keystore file
     ```bash
     base64 release-key.keystore | tr -d '\n'
     ```
   - `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS`: Your key alias (e.g., "release")
   - `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`: Keystore password
   - `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD`: Key password

### 4. iOS Release Setup (Production)

For iOS App Store releases:

1. **Add Repository Secrets**:
   - `APPLE_TEAM_ID`: Your Apple Developer Team ID
   - Additional iOS signing certificates as needed

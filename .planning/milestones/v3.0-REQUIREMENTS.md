## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Live friend tracking | Requires network connectivity |
| Turn-by-turn navigation | Overkill for event, use external maps |
| 3D/AR views | Adds complexity without clear benefit |
| Continuous background GPS | Severe battery drain in remote environment |
| User accounts/profiles | Unnecessary friction, local-only is sufficient |
| Chat/messaging | Requires network, out of scope for companion app |
| Tile download management | Pre-bundled tiles simpler, guaranteed to work |
